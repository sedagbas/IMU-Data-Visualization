# IMU-Data-Visualization

This project involves visualising data obtained from the MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor via serial communication through Arduino and storing it in a database. The data is displayed in real-time on a graphical user interface (GUI) and saved to an SQLite database.
